# Abstract Factory Pattern

The abstract factory pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

In the abstract factory pattern, a factory interface defines a set of methods for creating objects, and concrete factory classes implement these methods to create objects of a particular type. The objects created by the factory are related by a common theme or concept, and they are designed to work together as a cohesive whole.

The abstract factory pattern is useful when you want to create a set of related objects, but you do not want to specify the concrete classes of the objects. It allows you to change the objects that are created by the factory without changing the code that uses the factory.
